# Overview

Lunchtime Voter is a primarily two things - fun project for teams and weekend exploration of bleeding edge technologies <echo>OF THE FUTURE</echo>.

### Possible Future Technologies

* Ionic 2 Hybrid Apps
* Swift 2.0 iOS apps
* Android Studio based Android Apps (Java 7, newest OS, etc)

## The App

The app idea itself is basically a tool for people to figure out where to go to lunch together.  
Pretty much everywhere I've ever worked, this primarily involved emailing or messaging 20 people about a hundred times:
"Do you want to go here?"  "Not Really, how bout here." "Not Really.  Anywhere but there" and so on.  Most of you
will know what I'm talking about :)  So this is just a quick way to get together and make a decision.  

Everyone gets to submit one idea for lunch. Everyone else votes on an idea.  The idea with the highest common point total wins,
and the group goes there for lunch.

TODO: Add some pics of the design prototype.
