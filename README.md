# Overview

Lunchtime Voter is a primarily two things: 1. An example project for Angular 2 and Firebase, and 2. a tool for teams to decide where to go for lunch.

## Technologies

* Typescript as web client language
* Angular 2 as framework
* Firebase as database
* Materialize.css as CSS framework. (This may get swapped out in the future when the angular team gets angular-material ready for Angular 2)

### Possible Future Technologies

* Ionic 2 Hybrid Apps
* Swift 2.0 iOS apps
* Android Studio based Android Apps (Java 7, newest OS, etc)

## The App

The app idea itself is basically a tool for people to figure out where to go to lunch together.  
Pretty much everywhere I've ever worked, this primarily involved emailing or messaging 20 people about a hundred times:
"Do you want to go here?"  "Not Really, how bout here." "Not Really.  Anywhere but there" and so on.  Most of you
will know what I'm talking about :)  So this is just a quick way to get together and make a decision.  

Everyone gets to submit one idea for lunch. Everyone else votes on an idea.  The idea with the highest common point total wins,
and the group goes there for lunch.

# Getting Started / Running

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# start the server
npm start 
```
go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.1.1`+ and NPM `2.10.0`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
npm run server # or either webpack-dev-server or npm run express
```

## Other commands 

### build files
```bash
npm run build  # or webpack
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch  # or webpack --watch
```

### run tests 
```bash
npm run test  # or karma start
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver-start  # or webdriver-manager start
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have webdriver running and a sever for the client app
npm run e2e  # or protractor
```

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## .d.ts Typings
The TSD typings in `tsd_typings/` are autogenerated.

```
npm install --global tsd
```
